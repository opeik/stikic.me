My highlight of 2019 was working on Akuma Shei.
Itâ€™s a roguelike heavily inspired by NetHack that we created for our
Games Design and Programming assignment. My contribution was
writing the CMake build system, integrating SDL2 and ImGui into the engine,
as well as resolving 700+ errors and warnings in the legacy engine.
