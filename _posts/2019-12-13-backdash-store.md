Our Web and Mobile Development assignment required us to
create a storefront with a LAMP stack and no dependencies.
We decided to develop a store that sells fighting game gear.
It features a shop, cart, user system, and product manager.
Backdash fetches all store data from a persistent MySQL database.

You can find the [source code here](https://github.com/opeik/backdash-store).
