As much as I love Tekken, I found the lack of in-game tutorial very
frustrating when I was learning. The sheer amount of unexplained
complex mechanics makes it very intimidating for new players.
I created the Tekken Handbook as a reference intended for beginner
and intermediate Tekken players to alleviate this lack of documentation.

You can find the work-in-progress [Tekken Handbook here](https://tekken.stikic.me),
and the [source code here](https://github.com/opeik/tekken-handbook).
