Hi, I’m a software developer based in Perth, Australia. My interests include
UNIX, systems programming, game engines, Unicode, cryptography, typography, and
fighting games. I’m an active user of [GitHub](https://github.com/opeik) and an
avid supporter of open-source software. Generally, I release my projects under
the permissive ISC license; even this site, which is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/opeik/stikic.me)!

You can contact me via {% include email.html %} or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamopeik).
