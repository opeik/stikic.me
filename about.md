Hi, I’m a software developer based in Perth, Australia. My interests include
UNIX, systems programming, game engines, Unicode, cryptography, typography, and
fighting games. I’m an active user of [GitHub](https://github.com/opeik) and an
avid supporter of open-source software. Generally, I release my projects under
the ISC license. Even this site, which is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/opeik/stikic.me)!

I’ve worked with a wide range of stacks, both native and web, as well as front
and back end. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and skillset
by learning about new and old technologies.

You can contact me at [sandro@stikic.me](mailto:sandro@stikic.me) or
